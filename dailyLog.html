  <h1>Daily Log</h1>
<p><b>5/31/2016:</b> Today was our first day of our internship. We introduced ourselves and talked about our project. Then, we worked on our sample webpages that describe ourt project and will have our daily progress on them. I.E., this page.</p>

<p><b>6/1/2016:</b> Today, I finished working on my sample webpage. I began working on the webpage for my actual project. The homepage is pretty full of what is needed. It also links to the pages that describe what information is going to be calculated. I started the page that will be used to calculate but I paused to work on a test page. I have to figure out exactly what I need to calculate and how I want to do that.

<p><b>6/1/2016:</b> Today I made a lot of progress with my form, Budget Calculator. I made it add up the monthly savings with the projected costs and then subtract monthly expenses to feed out how much discretionary money they'll have left after all the expense costs get taken out. I have to make a page for the one time costs and once they know that they are prepared to start uo the company then it will lead to the page where they'll make sure that they'll be prepared for the first 12 months of business.</p>
