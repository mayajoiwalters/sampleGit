  <h1>Daily Log</h1>
<p><b>5/31/2016:</b> Today was our first day of our internship. We introduced ourselves and talked about our project. Then, we worked on our sample webpages that describe ourt project and will have our daily progress on them. I.E., this page.</p>

<p><b>6/1/2016:</b> Today. I finished working on my sample webpage. I began working on the webpage for my actual project. The homepage is pretty full of what is needed. It also links to the pages that describe what information is going to be calculated. I started the page that will be used to calculate but I paused to work on a test page. I have to figure out exactly what I need to calculate and how I want to do that.
